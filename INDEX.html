                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hey! Let's dive a bit deeper into who I am, both as a person and a upcoming developer:
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Who am I?</strong>
                        I'm in my early 20s, started coding when I was 18, and have been on this adventurous journey ever since. 
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Developer Aspirations:</strong>
                        I aim to be a developer who not only codes but understands the nuances of the projects I undertake, making sure they resonate with the users.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Ambitions:</strong>
                        I want to blend the latest tech with user-friendly interfaces to create digital experiences that matter.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Skills:</strong>
                        Apart from programming languages (you can peek into my projects for those!), I pride myself on my communication, problem-solving, and adaptability skills.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Hobbies:</strong>
                        When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me exploring new tech gadgets or getting lost in a good book.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Why Hire Me?</strong>
                        I bring a fresh perspective, endless enthusiasm, and a dedication to not just get the job done, but to make it shine.
                        <br><br>

                <h2>THE ANIMAL ISLAND</h2>
                <p>So this is a game i made where you hunt animals in a island with different kind of weapons as an example one of the characters has a bow gun and a spear .
                    The project  at that time was all about creating something that was diffuclt for us students in my case i had great difficulty using C# and working with UNITY so i challenged myself to
                     create a game that i could be proud of for my first attempt.The project was solo so all the contribution was given to me.I learned a great amount of things ,
                     by watching tutorials and a lot of trial and error i learned that i could even build something that i thought impossible at that time.
                     The coding language that was used on this project was C# and the program the i used to develop the game was UNITY</p>

                <h2>PRODUCT SHOWCASE WEBSITE</h2>
                <p>In this project i worked with diffrent people from diffrent educations and the goal of this project was to create a product for a song festival.
                    In this case my team decided to go with an armband and every one of us had different tasks ahead,1 of them was charged with making the logo
                     of the product and another one with the product itself while i was the one that had to take everything and make it look good in a website
                      form.My contribution was pretty evenly i would say ,everybody had diffrent things to do and we all did what we said we where gonna do.I 
                      learned a lot about teamwork on this project,learning to listen and also give my opinions about things be it positive of negetive , it
                       gave me a good idea of what the work space would look like in a real company .There where a lot of tools used for this project but if
                        its specifically about me then i used HTML AND CSS and some JAVASCRIPT.</p>

                <h2>THE MINI ARDUINO PIANO</h2>
                <p>So this is a project i made recently cause i was very intrested in physical computing,its basically a miny piano where
                     the moment you click on one of the buttos you get a sound back as feedback and of course every button has a diffrent 
                     sound effect.The project was made between me and a classmate of mine and we both worked on it.I learned that physical
                      computing is actually really fun cause you can creat a lot of this miny projects and thats really fun to do .
                      The language that was used in this project was Javascript and the Program used was ARDUINO also most of the work was done physically 
                      on the arduino board. </p>
